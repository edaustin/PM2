    <h1>PM Help</h1>
1326 Possible hands enumerated on the Villain Range Chart

    <h2 style="color:blue;">General</h2>
    <font size="5dp">
    PM is a Texas Hold 'em Poker analyser written to run on Android devices. It significantly improves on every Hold 'em calculator on the market by offering several completely unique features.
    </font>

    <h2 style="color:blue;">Wheel Entry System</h2>
    The user dials in their hand from left to right. At any stage the player may go back to a previous wheel, however all forward wheels are then reset, this is
    required for the algorithm to recalculate the hand correctly therefore flop pre-flop must be entered before flop before turn before river, this mirrors the game.
    <font size="5dp">

    </font>

    <h2 style="color:blue;">Pre-flop</h2>
    <font size="5dp">
    The player (designated 'Hero' in Poker terminology) dials in their two 'hole/'pocket' cards.
    <br>
    <br>
    PM computes the cards strength vs. other players (designated 'Villains' in Poker terminology) displaying this in a bar graph along with the Chen factor (normalized).
    The graph is displayed in three colors, the Red being the Villain pocket cards that are stronger than your own, the Green indicates you strength and the Yellow
    indicates Villains pocket cars that are potentially weaker than yours. You can view instant pre-flop strength here.
    <br>
    Invalid or no selection greys out the pre-flop strength bar graph.
    </font>


    <h2 style="color:blue;">Flop</h2>
    <font size="5dp">
    After pre-flop the player enters the flop cards. After this has been completed the software evaluates a number of factors.
    <br><br>
    1. Computes on the right hand side of the screen ALL possible card combinations available at the Flop including Villain (other player) cards and presents them in a scroll
    control that allows the player to instantly analyse their card strength. Again, Villains potential high cards red, the players cards are shown as green (and highlighted) whilst the villains
    potentially lower cards are shown in yellow. Similar coloring to the pre-flop bar graph color scheme. Touching the item initiates a pop-up with the pre-flop cards for that hand.
    <br><br>
    Another feature is that the card combination is highlighted IF the pre-flop range was demonstrably weak, indicating the hand is more unlikely as usually a villain would
    fold the hand pre-flop. Obviously this is far from fool-proof. The criteria for highlighting is a hand less than 25% weighted strength, these are weak hands rarely played consistently to the flop.

    <br><br>
    2. Best Turn/River 'out' for Hero  is shown for Hero in the Status box (below the Turn/River card wheels).
    <br><br>
    3. Auto evaluates your best current hand and displays it in the mini card sequence as well as on the status bar.

    <h2 style="color:blue;">Notes</h2>
    <font size="5dp">
            Pre-flop algorithms are not definitive.
        <br><br>
            Wheels need to settle before an accurate reading is given. Selecting a previously used card will give erratic results.
            This is usually avoided as used cards are indicated in the wheel values as red backs. In summary, all card values must be unique.

        <br><br>
            If the player has the nuts (such as a Royal Flush) no Red (Villain) or Green (Hero equals) are shown in the hand analysis only the Yellow (Villain) lower hands are shown.
            This is normal operation. No Hero position is shown between Villain hi-lo's if an exact match is not found, in this case only a better or worse hand can differentiate from the
            current (without equal) hand.
