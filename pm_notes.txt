-----net comments

**What matters is the equity of your current hand on the current board versus your opponent(s)' current range**

If you need to compute equities involving many players with fat distributions in fractions of a second, you'll gravitate towards Monte Carlo (rather than
exhaustive)



------

need to iterate off-UI all the villain range vs current hero and order the listview by equity of each hand, this will effectively show you the hands that
will likely beat you in the current game unlike the strength indicator which will only show you the CURRENT situation (useful only as a guide) as for example
you might be one from a royal flush (1-4) but the Villains22 beats you currently!
give this as an example flush against 22!
show the outs and discuss!

s calc off ui and dynamically write back to the UI updating as we progress


Instant Pre-flop weightings (heads-up, 6Max, ,10Max chen) shows your pre-flop hand strength.

Analysis of flop texture with Player optimal hand displayed.

Hero flop compared in real-time with all possible Villain hands with feedback of your hand-strength v Villain possibles. You can scroll through every possible hand color coded according to strength.
This allows you to compare your hand with the hand villains potentially hold and act accordingly, it also shows 'the nuts'. Also Full Flop range of all Players hands displayed graphically and
evaluated by strength and All-in-equity.



Displays all your current odds of achieving an out at any stage.

Predicts Villain and Hero best hand at Turn an River and compares with your current hand!

need to do

wrap in container args for async task
change crypto to an async task passing in params


problems
passing ctx into an async task
container = x
cxonstructor = x


issue: trying to get AsyncTask working in Scala

  Caused by: java.lang.AbstractMethodError: abstract method not implemented
            at android.os.AsyncTask.doInBackground(AsyncTask.java)

used
/data/adt/android-sdk-linux/build-tools/20.0.0/dexdump
find AsyncTask
not implemented method

problem
java -> scala autoconvert didn't add the override!
as didn't bother @Override the original

   override protected def doInBackground(ctx: Context*): Void = {}
